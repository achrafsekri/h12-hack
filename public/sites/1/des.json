  "description": "Jamaa Sidi Okba, recognized as one of the most significant monuments in the ruins of Sbiba, is situated east of the present city on an elevated site that overlooks the Sbiba plain, positioned between the city and Oued El Htab. The structure is aligned in a north-west to south-east orientation, featuring dimensions of approximately 22.7 m (north), 23.1 m (east), 22 m (south), and 23.8 m (west).Historical Context Originally believed to have served as a Christian basilica, the building was repurposed into a mosque during the early period of Arab occupation. According to various sources, it is suggested that before its adaptation for Muslim worship, the structure may have functioned as a richly decorated church. The existing architectural elements include Corinthian columns and other reused materials which showcase the continuity of sacred practices through time."
