  "name": "Hr. Souk Er Roumane",
  "description": "Hr. Souk Er Roumane is an archaeological site notable for its water management structures, particularly an aqueduct that connects it to the surrounding area. The site spans approximately 2,000 square meters and features a basin surrounded by walls and several fortifications to withstand water pressure. The basin's design likely served an agricultural purpose, aiding irrigation for the nearby fields. The aqueduct's construction reflects Roman engineering practices, characterized by its orientation and the gentle slope created to facilitate water flow. This aqueduct is part of a larger network that appears to link with the water supply system of other nearby sites, such as the thermal baths at Hr. Salsala, suggesting a sophisticated approach to urban planning and resource management during the time.Artifacts discovered at the site include common and sigillated ceramic fragments, indicating a long history of habitation and use[5]``[6]. The area's archaeological significance has led to careful archaeological assessments, although some structures have suffered from erosion and modern agricultural practices."
