  "description": "Sidi Ali Ech Chaib covers an area of approximately 2000 square meters, situated at the base of Jebel Mghila in Tunisia. The site features a collapsed zaouia built within an ancient rectangular basin oriented north-south. Historically, the site is significant due to its architectural remnants that highlight its various uses through different eras, particularly during the Roman and Byzantine periods. Among the prominent structures at the site is a prayer hall marked by a mihrab, identifiable for its half-circular apse, which now serves as a place for offerings. The prayer hall was originally supported by four columns, of which only two remain intact, showcasing intricate Corinthian capitals indicative of its architectural style. The origins of the chapiteaux can be dated back to the late 5th century, showcasing the blend of different influences within the decorative elements"
